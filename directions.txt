In this game, you must: determine your move without your opponent seeing it, press ENTER, and then it's time to your opponent determine its move without you seeing it. To purchase boats of different sizes, click the panel close to the harbor. As the size of each boat varies, this unit will have different attributes such as hit points, strength, damage, range of movement and attack, among others. To determine the location to which a boat must go, select it by clicking it (an arrow appears) and click somewhere to be marked with an X. When the action comes, the boats that are in range of another will take damage. The goal is to destroy the enemy's harbor. For this, put your boats near this target.
